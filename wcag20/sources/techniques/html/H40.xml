      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide the definitions of words or phrases by
            presenting them in a definition list. The list is marked up using the <el>dl</el>
            element. Within the list, each term is put in a separate <el>dt</el> element, and
            its definition goes in the <el>dd</el> element directly following it. The
              <att>title</att> attribute can be used to provide additional information about the
            definition list. </p>
      <p>Using <el>dl</el>, <el>dt</el>, and <el>dd</el> ensures that relationships
            between terms and their definitions are preserved if the presentation format changes and
            that the list of terms and definitions is treated as a unit.</p>
      <p>Definition lists are easiest to use when the definitions are put in alphabetical order.
            Definition lists are typically used in a glossary.</p>
